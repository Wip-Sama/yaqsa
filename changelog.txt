  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash on start after adding compatibility with planet picker mod
  Changes:
    - Now the gui will appear from the start even with the planet picker mod
  Known Issues:
    - If you add an element while planet picker mod is enabled and the player is not on the surface, the count will set the main inventory size to 0, to fix this you need to select a planet and add/remove an item to update the gui, Ill fix this on a later date
  Planned:
    - Death quickstart
    - Support for quality

Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2024-01-15
  Added:
    - Everything
  Planned:
    - Quick revive kit (or maybe another mod)
    - A command to edit the quickstart after it has been set
    - A way for other mods to add preset
    - Search bar for the presets
    - A way to export your quickstart to a string and import it somewhere (maybe export it in blueprint in a combinator?)
    - Rewrite some core logic to make it tighter (just the normal urge of each programmer to refactor its code because it's garbage)
    - Scripts for migrations (for migration I mean some edge cases while updating the mod/changing presets)
    - Localization
    - Basic quickstart for mods like Krastorio
  Notes:
    - This mod is actually in beta, bugs are to be expected
