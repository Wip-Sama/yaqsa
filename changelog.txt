Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2024-01-15
  Added:
    - Everything
  Planned:
    - Quick revive kit (or maybe another mod)
    - A command to edit the quickstart after it has been set
    - A way for other mods to add preset
    - Search bar for the presets
    - A way to export your quickstart to a string and import it somewhere (maybe export it in blueprint in a combinator?)
    - Rewrite some core logic to make it tighter (just the normal urge of each programmer to refactor its code because it's garbage)
    - Scripts for migrations (for migration I mean some edge cases while updating the mod/changing presets)
    - Localization
    - Basic quickstart for mods like Krastorio
  Notes:
    - This mod is actually in beta, bugs are to be expected
